## Important Features

The GroceryList Manager is loaded with powerful ready to use features: 

### Device Database 

The GLM comes equipped with a modestly sized, yet powerful client-side database that will allow you to update the grocery items that are not pre-loaded into the database. This feature is important, as we know that certain grocery items may be more niche and unique based on individualized tastes. Or if that new flavor of Ben & Jerry's just has been released and you have to try it. You, the user will have the power to add that new flavor into your database, which is categorized by grocery types for quick-easy use. Now that new Ben and Jerry flavor will not be forgotten in the freezer section any more! Our team of highly capable software engineers were able to implement this feature utilizing the Android Software Development Kit to ensure that there was no compatability errors. This means that you will always be able to add any item of your choice (to include its type). Our team has worked tirelessly to ensure that we covered all the basis and preloaded the GLM with a large array of different grocery items. We unfortunately are unable to tell the future, but until then, this is a nice little workaround! Once you have added that new flavor of ice cream to the database, it will not need to be added again. Just simply add an item to your list as you would regularly do, and the GLM will add that delicious flavor of ice cream to the regular item list page. <br>

#### Steps to Add New Items to the Database<br>

### Item Type?

What is the difference between a grocery item and a grocery type? This distinction is how our design team innovated, and designed our client-built database system to display all the loaded grocery items in an aesthic, pleasing manner. Making it easy to find, add items to the specified list. This system is application wide, as even the search bar functionality works by filtering first on grocery type before said individual items. This built in feature also speeds up the retrieval of grocery item searches due to the filtering on type intially being done first. 


## User Interface
